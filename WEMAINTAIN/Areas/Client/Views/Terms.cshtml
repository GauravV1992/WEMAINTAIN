Ltd<strong>.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>The FixMySpace Services are made available to Customer by FixMySpace and are subject to the following Terms of Service (the "Terms") and&nbsp; Privacy Policy &nbsp;(“Privacy Policy”). FixMySpace may also offer other services under different terms of service.</p>
                    <p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE(S)</strong></p>
                    <p>FixMySpace provides Customer with access to an array of contact management, task management, Services, social networking and unified messaging services, available both via electronic internet access and mobile access via the FixMySpace IoS and Android applications, to manage and enhance internal and external business relationships (“Service(s)”). Customer may connect to the Services using any Internet browser or utilizing the FixMySpace IoS or Android mobile applications. Customer is responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services. Customer is responsible for any fees, data charges or surcharges that may be assessed by Customer’s individual mobile data carrier incurred in connection with Customer’s use of the Services.</p>
                    <p><strong>LIMITED LICENSE GRANT</strong></p>
                    <p>FixMySpace hereby grants to Customer a nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable limited license, for Customer’s use only, for the term of this Agreement, to access and use the Services and any user’s guides, specifications, and other related documentation available online (the “Documentation”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                    <p><strong>WHY FAIR USE LIMITS?</strong></p>
                    <p>Some restrictions apply to unlimited users for starter, advance &amp; premium plans. Based on fair usage policy we limit users per account to ensure that every subscriber uses the platform in moderation.
